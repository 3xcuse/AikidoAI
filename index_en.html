                        <h2>What does aikido give you?</h2>
                        <p>You learn to move your body in unity and improve your posture – this builds confidence and determination visible to others.</p>
                        <p>A confident person is much less likely to be bullied than someone radiating uncertainty.</p>
                        <p>You learn techniques that rely on timing, spatial awareness and spontaneous recognition rather than brute force.</p>
                        <p>The technical structure of aikido develops these skills through regular practice.</p>
                        <p>Your reaction time will shorten so you can respond before physical action fully unfolds.</p>
                        <p>Your mindset will change and you start to look at yourself and the world differently.</p>
