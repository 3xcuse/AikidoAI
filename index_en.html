                        Here are a few points to help turn intent into action:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Would you like healthy confidence, a firm attitude and great stamina?</li><br>
                            <li>Interested in learning conflict management through movement?</li><br>
                            <li>Curious about Japanese martial culture rooted in samurai traditions and based on sword (katana) movements?</li><br>
                            <li>Want to try a martial art where beginners are treated with care?</li><br>
                            <li>Looking for the most “spiritual” budo?</li><br>
                            <li>Would you like to belong to a community driven not by ego but by the will to improve?</li><br>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>What does aikido give you?</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You learn to move your body in unity and improve your posture – this builds confidence and determination visible to others.<br>
                            A confident person is much less likely to be bullied than someone radiating uncertainty.</li><br>
                            <li>You learn techniques that rely on timing, spatial awareness and spontaneous recognition rather than brute force.<br>
                            The technical structure of aikido develops these skills through regular practice.</li><br>
                            <li>Your reaction time will shorten so you can respond before physical action fully unfolds.</li><br>
                            <li>Your mindset will change and you start to look at yourself and the world differently.</li><br>
                        </ul>
