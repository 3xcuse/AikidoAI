                        <h2>The story of Misogi Dojo</h2>
                        <p>Misogi Dojo is located in the heart of Budapest and has welcomed aikido enthusiasts since 1995. Our founders set out to create a harmonious community where traditional values meet a modern outlook. Alongside technique, our practice puts great emphasis on mindful body use and mental growth. We regularly invite renowned instructors from abroad to broaden our students' horizons. Training sessions are held in a friendly atmosphere yet demand disciplined commitment. We believe aikido is not just movement, but a lifelong path that helps preserve inner peace. Beginners and advanced practitioners alike find their own pace and support each other's progress. Our classes stress gradual, injury-free training so everyone can feel safe. Modern equipment and an easily accessible location make practice comfortable. If you want to join an open, supportive community and follow your own path in aikido, you belong with us.</p>
