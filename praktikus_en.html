                            <li>If you want to be the new Seagal/Bruce Lee in half a year.</li>
                            <li>If you seek competitions and medals.</li>
                            <li>If you think you improve by defeating others.</li>
                            <li>If you solve everything with brute force and don't want to change.</li>
                            <li>If you expect aikido to solve your problems instead of yourself.</li>

                        <h2>Five misconceptions about Aikido</h2>
                        <p>"Aikido is just dance and doesn't work in real life."</p>
                        <p>That's common among people who never practiced it.</p>
                        <p>"Moves are too complicated to learn."</p>
                        <p>"It's not a sport so it cannot be measured."</p>
                        <p>"It takes at least 10 years to learn."</p>
                        <p>"I'm too old to start."</p>
